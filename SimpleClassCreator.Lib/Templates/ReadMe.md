# What are these C# files?
These C# files are templates and not intended to be buildable code. They are read in by this program and there are tags that are replaced. Edit them at your own risk.

## Why are there strings wrapped in curly braces?
- Those are the aforementioned tags. They look like this: `{{TagName}}`
- These tags are replaced dynamically while generating code.
- In the future, it may be possible to provide your own, but it's low on the list of priorties.
